 Discord Remote COntroll is a one stop shop for controlling and debuggind Discord bots, right from your browser.

## Features

### Filtering (80%)

Filter through all the messages your bot gets to see what it sees.

#### Progress
More or less working, with the exception of filtering by indirect mentions.

### Chatting (20%)

Take direct control of your bot and sent whatever messages you need.

#### Progress
The groundwork is there, but some testing needs to be done regarding self-DMs on bots before I decide which way to take this feature.

### Other Features, Present and Future

* self-DM private api
* persistent logging
* Proper Discord-like interface
